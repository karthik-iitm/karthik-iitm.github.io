    "text": "Optimization\nA third example of a reversible transformation appears in optimization problems.

If we wish to be really rigorous, we can start by looking at the feasible set. This remains the same for both the problems as the constraints haven’t changed. Let us call this set \\(F\\). If \\((x_{1},y_{1})\\) maximizes the first version, what does it mean?\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}}\\geq\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}},\\,\\,\\forall\\,(x,y)\\in F\n\\]\nSince both sides are positive, this means:\n\\[\nx_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}\\geq x^{2}+y^{2},\\,\\forall\\,(x,y)\\in F\n\\]\nThus \\((x_{1},y_{1})\\) maximizes the second version. We can now go in the other direction and the result will be the same. The operation of “squaring” the objective happened to be reversible in this case. Another reversible transformation in the context of optimization is to maximize the log-likelihood instead of the likelihood.",

    "text": "Let \\(W\\) be a finite dimensional real vector space, and let \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) be two subspaces of \\(W\\). Let \\(U+V\\) be the space\n\\[\nU+V=\\{u+v\\,:\\,u\\in U\\text{ and }v\\in V\\}\n\\]\nShow the following:\n\n\\(U+V\\) is a subspace of \\(W\\).\n\\(\\text{dim}(U+V)=\\text{dim}(U)+\\text{dim}(V)-\\text{dim}(U\\cap V)\\)\n\n\nWe see that \\(0\\in U+V\\). If \\(u_{1}+v_{1}\\in U+V\\) and \\(u_{2}+v_{2}\\in U+V\\), then \\((u_{1}+u_{2})+(v_{1}+v_{2})\\in U+V\\). If \\(u+v\\in U+V\\) and \\(\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}\\), then \\(\\lambda(u+v)=\\lambda u+\\lambda v\\in U+V\\). Using these three observations, we conclude that \\(U+V\\) is a subspace of \\(W\\).\nWe know that \\(U\\cap V\\) is a subspace of \\(W\\). Let \\(\\{w_{1},\\cdots,w_{k}\\}\\) be a basis for \\(U\\cap V\\). We can now extend this to a basis for \\(U\\) and a basis for \\(V\\). The two bases are \\(\\{w_{1},\\cdots,w_{k},u_{1},\\cdots,u_{m}\\}\\) for \\(U\\) and \\(\\{w_{1},\\cdots,w_{k},v_{1},\\cdots,v_{n}\\}\\) for \\(V\\). Consider the set \\(\\{w_{1},\\cdots,w_{k},u_{1},\\cdots,u_{m},v_{1},\\cdots,v_{n}\\}.\\) It is quite easy to see that this set spans \\(U+V\\). If we can show that this set is also linearly independent, then we have a basis for \\(U+V\\).\nLet us take a linear combination of this collection and set it to zero:\n\\[\n(a_{1}w_{1}+\\cdots+a_{k}w_{k})+(b_{1}u_{1}+\\cdots+b_{m}u_{m})+(c_{1}v_{1}+\\cdots+c_{n}v_{n})=0\n\\]\nWe can now group the terms in the following way:\n\\[\na_{1}w_{1}+\\cdots+a_{k}w_{k}+b_{1}u_{1}+\\cdots+b_{m}u_{m}=-(c_{1}v_{1}+\\cdots+c_{n}v_{n})\n\\]\nThe LHS is a vector in \\(U\\) and the RHS is a vector in \\(V\\). Since the two are equal, the vector in question is in \\(U\\cap V\\). We can now express this using the basis for \\(U\\cap V\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-(c_{1}v_{1}+\\cdots+c_{n}v_{n}) & =d_{1}w_{1}+\\cdots+d_{k}w_{k}\\\\\nc_{1}v_{1}+\\cdots+c_{n}v_{n}+d_{1}w_{1}+\\cdots+d_{k}w_{k} & =0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis is actually a linear combination of the basis vectors of \\(V\\) set to zero. Hence, \\(c_{1}=\\cdots=c_{n}=d_{1}=\\cdots d_{k}=0\\). Going back to the original equation, we conclude that \\(a_{1}=\\cdots=a_{k}=b_{1}=\\cdots=b_{m}=0\\). This implies, the set \\(\\{w_{1},\\cdots,w_{k},u_{1},\\cdots,u_{m},v_{1},\\cdots,v_{n}\\}\\) is linearly independent. We therefore have shown that this is a basis for \\(U+V\\).\nFrom this, the formula that relates the dimensions of the subspaces \\(U,V,U\\cap V\\) and \\(U+V\\) follows:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{dim}(U+V)=\\text{dim}(U)+\\text{dim}(V)-\\text{dim}(U\\cap V)}\n\\]",

Let us call the \\(i^{th}\\) normalized eigenvectors of \\(XX^{T}\\) \\(w_{i}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nw_{i} & =\\cfrac{Xv_{i}}{\\left|\\left|Xv_{i}\\right|\\right|}\\\\\n\\\\ & =\\cfrac{Xv_{i}}{\\sqrt{v_{i}^{T}X^{T}Xv_{i}}}\\\\\n\\\\ & =\\cfrac{Xv_{i}}{\\sqrt{v_{i}^{T}(X^{T}Xv_{i})}}\\\\\n\\\\ & =\\cfrac{Xv_{i}}{\\sqrt{v_{i}^{T}(\\lambda_{i}v_{i})}}\\\\\n\\\\ & =\\cfrac{Xv_{i}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_{i}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere we have used the fact that \\(v_{i}\\) is a normalized eigenvector of \\(X^{T}X\\) with a non-zero eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_{i}\\). Therefore, the eigenpairs of \\(XX^{T}\\) with normalized eigenvectors are:\n\\[\n\\left(\\lambda_{1},\\cfrac{Xv_{1}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_{1}}}\\right),\\cdots,\\left(\\lambda_{r},\\cfrac{Xv_{r}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_{r}}}\\right)\n\\]\nBut we are not interested in just \\(XX^{T}\\), but the covariance matrix \\(C\\), which is \\(C=\\cfrac{1}{n}XX^{T}\\). Scaling a matrix retains the eigenvectors but scales the eigenvalues. So the eigenpairs of \\(C\\) are:\n\\[\n\\left(\\cfrac{\\lambda_{1}}{n},\\cfrac{Xv_{1}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_{1}}}\\right),\\cdots,\\left(\\cfrac{\\lambda_{r}}{n},\\cfrac{Xv_{r}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_{r}}}\\right)\n\\]",

    "section": "Non-linear Datasets",
    "text": "Non-linear Datasets\nMost of the times, datasets are too complex to comfortably fit into a lower dimensional subspace. Datasets are in general structurally non-linear. Vanilla PCA may thus fail to capture a good representation. Or we may have to include a large number of principal components to capture \\(95\\%\\) of the variance, defeating the whole purpose of PCA.\nOne way to get around this problem is to think of a non-linear transformation of the features and hope that the transformed dataset has a linear structure in this larger feature space. This is not too naive an expectation. To see why this might work, consider the following dataset in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\):\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThere is a relationship between \\(x_{2}\\) and \\(x_{1}\\) which can roughly be captured as \\(x_{2}=x_{1}^{2}\\). Consider the transformation below:\n\\[\n\\phi(x_{1},x_{2})=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\\nx_{1}\\\\\nx_{1}^{2}-x_{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis maps the data-points from \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\), the plane to the space. But given the nature of the dataset, the transformed dataset would lie roughly along the y-axis in the 3d plane. Thus, the transformation \\(\\phi\\) has managed to convert a non-linear dataset in the original feature space to a linear dataset in the transformed space. In reality, things might not be so straightforward. Nevertheless, this gives us some intuition as to what transformations can do.\nWe can also look at one more transformation:\n\\[\n\\phi(x_{1,}x_{2})=\\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}\\\\\nx_{1}^{2}\\\\\nx_{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nConsider the line \\(w^{T}x=0\\), where \\(w=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\\n1\\\\\n-1\n\\end{bmatrix}\\) in the transformed space. Most of the transformed data-points are going to lie roughly along this line.\nProceeding with this idea, let us assume that there is a (potentially non-linear) map \\(\\phi\\,\\,:\\,\\,\\)\\(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{D}\\) that maps the feature space \\(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}^{D}\\). The transformed data-matrix is \\(\\phi(X)\\):\n\\[\n\\phi(X)=\\begin{bmatrix}\\vert &  & \\vert\\\\\n\\phi(x_{1}) & \\cdots & \\phi(x_{n})\\\\\n\\vert &  & \\vert\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis is a \\(D\\times n\\) matrix. We can now proceed with PCA on the data-matrix \\(\\phi(X)\\). But what if \\(D\\) is huge? After all, we are trying to move to a higher dimension and it is quite likely that \\(D\\) would be huge for really complex datasets. So we go back to working with the Gram matrix like in section-1. There is another great advantage of this which will be discussed later. We will now define the Gram matrix as:\n\\[\nK=\\phi(X)^{T}\\phi(X)\n\\]\nThe eigenpairs of the Gram matrix are:\n\\[\n(\\lambda_{1},v_{1}),\\cdots,(\\lambda_{r},v_{r})\n\\]\nwhere \\(r\\) is the rank of \\(K\\). Note that \\(r\\leq\\min(D,n)\\). From this, we can get hold of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix \\(C=\\frac{1}{n}\\phi(X)\\phi(X)^{T}\\) as:\n\\[\n\\left(\\cfrac{\\lambda_{1}}{n},\\cfrac{\\phi(X)v_{1}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_{1}}}\\right),\\cdots,\\left(\\cfrac{\\lambda_{r}}{n},\\cfrac{\\phi(X)v_{r}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_{r}}}\\right)\n\\]\nAll this is good if we know the precise form of the transformation \\(\\phi\\). But most often, we may not know what this transformation is. Even if we know this, we would have to compute it for every data-point.\nThe computationally intensive step here is the eigen-decomposition of the Gram matrix. So let us take a closer look at it. Notice that it has the form \\(\\phi(X)^{T}\\phi(X)\\). For computing the Gram matrix, what we need is the pair-wise inner products in the transformed space. Is there any tool that will give us these inner products without having to explicitly compute \\(\\phi(x)\\)? There is such a tool and it is called a kernel.\nA kernel is a function \\(k:\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}\\), such that there exists a \\(\\phi:\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{D}\\)\n\\[\nk(x_{1},x_{2})=\\phi(x_{1})^{T}\\phi(x_{2})\n\\]\nThis is a loose definition as the transformed space need not necessarily be finite dimensional. Besides, the inner product in the transformed space may not necessarily be the dot product.",

It wants you to predict the average sales in the coming quarter.\n\n\nHere we are lucky. Someone comes to our doorstep and gives us the data. It might be the case that the company has neatly arranged the data in a tabular format. In addition, we also have a very precise definition of the problem statement. We have to predict a real number by looking at the data. It is a regression problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario-2\n\n\n\nTwitter is developing an algorithm to detect tweets that contain offensive content. As a data scientist, you are given a dump of one million tweets and asked to develop an algorithm to solve the problem.\n\n\nThis is a more challenging problem compared to scenario-1. First, this is an instance of what is called a binary classification problem. Instead of predicting a real number, we have to predict one of two (binary) outcomes for each tweet:\n\noffensive\nnot-offensive\n\nIn order to train a computer to distinguish between the two kinds of tweets, we need to give it examples of tweets of both kinds. Unfortunately, we don’t have that information. If that information is absent, how can we teach the computer to differentiate between the two? So, the first task here is to get the dataset labeled. That is, for each tweet, mark it as “offensive” or “not-offensive”. This process is time consuming and requires considerable manpower, especially if the dataset is large.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario-3\n\n\n\nYou are a research scientist at a manufacturing company. You want to set up a facility that automates the segregation of defective products from non-defective ones. Come up with an end-end ML solution.\n\n\nThis is by far the most challenging scenario. We don’t have access to the data. We need to gather data in the first place. Once we have the data, we need to label it or annotate it. Only then can we start thinking about training ML models on top of the data.",

Exams are so ubiquitous that we often conflate learning with scoring well in exams. However, for a machine, getting a good score in an exam is a good enough proxy for learning. For almost every skill that we can think of, there is some test or exam to evaluate our competency in that skill. Take the analogy that we have been working with: three-digit addition. To know if kids have learnt addition, teachers conduct tests that have problems on three digit addition.\nAn important feature of testing is to make sure that it is challenging. If we ask the same questions that are there in the textbook, kids might score high marks. But chances are that a lot of them would have memorized the answers. Therefore, whenever we have a dataset, we always partition it into two parts:\n\ntrain-dataset\ntest-dataset\n\nWe train the model on the train-dataset and evaluate its performance on the test-dataset. But often, we don’t stop with two partitions, we go for three partitions:\n\ntrain-dataset\nvalidation-dataset\ntest-dataset\n\nThink about the validation-dataset as additional problems for practice or a mock exam that helps the machine learn a good model. The test-dataset is not shown to the model during the learning stage. The learning algorithm has access to only the train-dataset and the validation-dataset. Once the learning process is complete, the model is evaluated on the test-dataset. The test-dataset is sacred in any ML problem. It should be kept hidden and used only at the end. This is analogous to the effort taken by the administration of colleges and universities to seal exam papers and keep them secure until the day of the examination. If the exam paper somehow gets leaked, the exam can no longer be conducted in a fair manner!",

This is nothing but our labeled dataset. We have to learn our weight vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). This leaves us with two questions:\n\nDoes the equation \\(\\mathbf{Xw} =\\mathbf{y}\\) have a solution?\nIf it doesn’t have a solution, how do we estimate \\(\\mathbf{w}\\)?\n\nThe answer to the first question is that, the equation \\(\\mathbf{Xw} =\\mathbf{y}\\) may not have a solution in practice. This could be because of the following reasons:\n\nCase-1: The relationship between \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is not linear.\nCase-2: Even if the relationship is linear, the labels may be corrupted by some noise \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\nRecall the quote with which we began this unit: “all models are wrong, but some are useful.” In the first case, we can’t do much. We would have to abandon the simple linear model and go for more complex models. In the second case, we still have hope. This situation is generally expressed as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathbf{y} =\\mathbf{Xw} +\\mathbf{\\epsilon }\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathbf{\\epsilon }\\) is some small error term. The error-term for each house is assumed to be a small value that is equal to zero on average. The general approach in such situations is to find a set of weights that minimizes the error in prediction. Here is what we mean by this:\nConsider the \\(\\displaystyle i^{th}\\) house. The actual selling price for it is \\(\\displaystyle y_{i}\\). The predicted selling price is \\(\\displaystyle f(\\mathbf{x}_{i})\\). Therefore, the error in prediction for this house is \\(\\displaystyle f(\\mathbf{x}_{i}) -y_{i}\\). Since we are only interested in the absolute value of the error, it is a good idea to square this quantity: \\(\\displaystyle [ f(\\mathbf{x}_{i}) -y_{i}]^{2}\\). Summing this term across all \\(\\displaystyle n\\) houses gives us a measure of how good the function \\(\\displaystyle f\\) is in predicting the selling prices:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{aligned}\nL(\\mathbf{w} ) & =\\sum\\limits _{i=1}^{n}[ f( x_{i}) -y_{i}]^{2}\\\\\n& \\\\\n& =\\sum\\limits _{i=1}^{n}\\left[\\mathbf{w}^{T}\\mathbf{x}_{i} -y_{i}\\right]^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nThis is called the sum of squared errors or SSE. The quantity \\(\\displaystyle L(\\mathbf{w})\\) is called the error function or the loss function. Lower the value of the loss function, better our model. The learning problem in linear regression can be formulated as finding a vector of weights — \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) — that will minimize the loss \\(L(\\mathbf{w} )\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\underset{\\mathbf{w}}{\\min} \\ \\ L(\\mathbf{w})\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nLet us now recast the loss function using the data-matrix \\(\\displaystyle \\mathbf{X}\\) and label vector \\(\\displaystyle \\mathbf{y}\\). Consider the vector \\(\\displaystyle \\mathbf{Xw}\\). This is a \\(\\displaystyle n\\times 1\\) vector that contains the predicted labels for all \\(\\displaystyle n\\) houses. So, the loss function can also be written as:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{aligned}\nL(\\mathbf{w}) & =\\sum\\limits _{i=1}^{n}[(\\mathbf{Xw})_{i} -y_{i}]^{2}\\\\\n& \\\\\n& =(\\mathbf{Xw} -\\mathbf{y} )^{T} (\\mathbf{Xw} -\\mathbf{y} )\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]",

Then \\(\\mathbf{Xw} \\neq \\mathbf{y}\\). This is by far the most interesting and relevant scenario from the perspective of the linear regression problem. Recall that we are trying to estimate a weight vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\), given the labeled dataset \\((\\mathbf{X} ,\\mathbf{y} )\\). The relationship between inputs and outputs is assumed to be linear. But the real world doesn’t behave exactly like we want it to. There are going to be obvious deviations from our ideal assumptions. In other words, our models can never be an entirely accurate representation of reality.\nThis is a typical scenario observed in engineering and the sciences. We don’t abandon the problem because it doesn’t admit an exact solution. Instead, we turn to a powerful weapon in our armory: approximations. Can we find a \\(\\mathbf{\\widehat{w}}\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{X}\\widehat{\\mathbf{w}} \\approx \\mathbf{y}\\)? What do we mean by the symbol \\(\\approx\\) here? We are dealing with two vectors on either side of the symbol. Let us first understand what the symbol means when we have scalars.\nLet us look at the following statements:\n\n\\(1.234\\approx 1\\)\n\\(1.234\\approx 1.2\\)\n\\(1.234\\approx 1.23\\)\n\nThese are three approximations. From experience, we know that the second approximation is better than the first and the third better than the second. If we plot these points on a real line, the goodness of an approximation can be interpreted using the distance between the original point and its approximation: smaller the distance, better the approximation.\nThis very idea is extended to an \\(n\\) dimensional vector space. If \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{\\widehat{y}}\\) are two vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\), then the Euclidean distance between them is a measure of the goodness of the approximation. To avoid taking square roots, we write down the expression for the squared distance:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n||\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}} -\\mathbf{y} ||^{2} =(\\widehat{y}_{1} -y_{1} )^{2} +\\cdots +(\\widehat{y}_{n} -y_{n} )^{2}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nThe key to solving the problem \\(\\mathbf{Xw} \\approx \\mathbf{y}\\), is to find a vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{w}}\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{X}\\widehat{\\mathbf{w}}\\) is as close to \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) as possible. This can be framed as an optimization problem:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\widehat{\\mathbf{w}} =\\underset{\\mathbf{w}}{\\arg\\min} \\ \\ ||\\mathbf{Xw} -\\mathbf{y} ||^{2}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nIf you are seeing \\(\\arg\\min\\) for the first time, think about it like a function (in the programming sense):\n\nFind the value that minimizes the expression\nReturn this value to the user",

Let us now turn our attention to the system after row reduction: \\[\n\\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{z}\n\\] First note that the set of pivot columns are linearly independent and form a basis for the column space of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\). In the example we are working with, this is quite clear: \\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathcal{R} (\\mathbf{R} )=\\text{span}\\left(\\left\\{\\begin{bmatrix}\n1\\\\\n0\\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix} ,\\begin{bmatrix}\n0\\\\\n1\\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\\right\\}\\right)\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nSo, \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the columns of this basis. Let us call this the particular solution \\(\\mathbf{w}_{p}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{w}_{n}\\) is some vector in the nullspace of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), then every general solution \\(\\mathbf{w}_{g}\\) to the equation can be expressed in this form:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathbf{w}_{g} =\\mathbf{w}_{p} +\\mathbf{w}_{n}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]\nIt may still not be clear why every solution should be of this form and we will prove this shortly. Before that, let us express the set of all solutions to a consistent system more formally: \\[\n\\mathbf{w}_p + \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{X})\n\\] This is an affine space. Geometrically, an affine space is a subspace that is translated by some vector. In the simple setting of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\), if the nullspace is a plane passing through the origin, then an affine space would be a plane parallel to it. Coming back to our context, the set of all solutions to \\(\\mathbf{Xw} = \\mathbf{y}\\) can be obtained by translating the nullspace of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) by a particular solution \\(\\mathbf{x}_p\\)​​.\n\n\nProof\nWe will show that this affine space is indeed the solution space. Let us call the set of all solutions \\(S\\). Now, pick up any element in the affine space: \\[\n\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{w}_p + \\mathbf{w}_n\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{w}_n \\in \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{X})\\). We see that \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is a solution because: \\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathbf{Xw} =\\mathbf{X} (\\mathbf{w}_{p} +\\mathbf{w}_{n} )=\\mathbf{Xw}_{p} +\\mathbf{Xw}_{n} =\\mathbf{y}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\] We have shown that any arbitrary element of the affine space is also present in \\(S\\).

In the exam, she will not have access to the answers. But more importantly, she will not even be asked the same questions! So, just memorizing the answers will not help. She would have to learn how addition works. She needs to have a mental model of addition. In other words, she would have to learn a function from the input (question) to the output (answer).\nThis is exactly what happens in a regression problem. The inputs are a set of data-points. The outputs corresponding to these inputs are real numbers called targets or labels. A regression model has to learn the mapping from input to output. Once this mapping or function is learnt, the model can then be used to predict the output on unseen inputs. The collection of data-points along with their targets is called a labeled dataset. A regression model makes use of this dataset to learn a function. A labeled dataset is nothing but the textbook problems in our analogy.",

Every house in a locality has the following features or attributes associated with it:\n\nlatitude\nlongitude\nage\nnumber of rooms\narea\ndistance from nearest school\n\nThe selling price of a house depends on these features.

Here is a quick reminder of when a matrix is in row-echelon matrix is:\n\nAll rows that have only zeros are at the bottom.\nThe first nonzero entry in a row is always to the right of the first nonzero entry in the row above it.\n\nThe first nonzero entry in a row is called a pivot and columns that contain pivots are called pivot columns. The row echelon form a matrix is not unique. However, we can reduce a matrix to its reduced row echelon form (RREF), which is unique. A matrix is in reduced row echelon form if:\n\nIt is in row echelon form.\nThe only nonzero entry in a pivot column is the pivot.\nAll pivots are equal to \\(1\\).\n\nThe matrix that we have obtained in this example is actually in RREF.

We state the following result without proof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is the reduced row echelon form of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), then \\(\\mathbf{Xw}=\\mathbf{0}\\) if and only if \\(\\mathbf{Rw}=\\mathbf{0}\\)\n\n\nThus, the nullspace of a matrix and the nullspace of its RREF are the same.

Let us try it out here. \\(w_{1}\\) and \\(w_{2}\\) are the pivot variables. \\(w_{3}\\) and \\(w_{4}\\) are the free variables. First, let us set \\(w_{3}=1,w_{4}=0\\). This gives us \\(w_{1}=1,w_{2}=-2\\). The first element of the basis is therefore \\(\\begin{bmatrix}1 & -2 & 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}^{T}\\). Next, we set \\(w_{3}=0,w_{4}=1\\). This gives us \\(w_{1}=0,w_{2}=-1\\). The second element of the basis is \\(\\begin{bmatrix}0 & -1 & 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}^{T}\\).

If we look at the columns, then we have \\({\\displaystyle r}\\) pivot columns. These \\({\\displaystyle r}\\) columns are linearly independent by construction. Therefore, each of the remaining \\({\\displaystyle d-r}\\) columns can be expressed as a unique linear combination of these \\({\\displaystyle r}\\) pivot columns. The coefficients of this linear combination are going to come from our \\({\\displaystyle d}\\) variables, \\({\\displaystyle w_{1},\\cdots,w_{d}}\\).\nRecall that the matrix \\({\\displaystyle \\mathbf{X}}\\) is \\({\\displaystyle n\\times d}\\). From the rank-nullity theorem, we know that the nullity is going to be \\(d-r\\). Thus a basis of \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{X})\\) will have \\(d-r\\) linearly independent vectors. We have to hunt for these \\(d-r\\) vectors. To get there, we divide the \\(d\\) variables into two parts:\n\n\\(r\\) pivot variables: variables corresponding to the pivot columns\n\\(d-r\\) free variables: all other variables\n\nTo get a basis vector, we set one of the \\(d-r\\) free variables to \\(1\\) and the rest to \\(0\\). Basically, here we are trying to express a non-pivot column as a linear combination of the \\({\\displaystyle r}\\) pivot columns. Then we determine the \\(r\\) pivot variables (coefficients of the combination) by solving the \\(r\\) equations corresponding to them. The resulting \\({\\displaystyle \\mathbf{w}}\\) vector is one element in the basis. By repeating this process with each of the \\(d-r\\) free variables, we are guaranteed to have \\(d-r\\) linearly independent vectors.",

Let us now work with this special case:\n\\[\nA=\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix},\\,\\,\\,x=\\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}\\\\\nx_{2}\\\\\nx_{3}\\\\\nx_{4}\n\\end{bmatrix},\\,\\,\\,\\,b=\\begin{bmatrix}b_{1}\\\\\nb_{2}\\\\\n0\\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nWe can give arbitrary values to \\(x_{2}\\) and \\(x_{4}\\) and then solve for \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{3}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{2} & =t_{2}\\\\\nx_{4} & =t_{4}\\\\\nx_{3} & =b_{2}-t_{4}\\\\\nx_{1} & =b_{1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe set of all solutions to the system is given by:\n\\[\nS=\\left\\{ \\left(b_{1},t_{2},b_{2}-t_{4},t_{4}\\right):t_{2},t_{4}\\in\\mathbb{R}\\right\\}\n\\]",

    "text": "Row operations preserve row space\nIf a matrix \\(A\\) has \\(n\\) rows, say \\(r_{1},\\cdots,r_{n}\\), then the span of the rows is the set of all possible linear combinations of the rows and is called the row space of the matrix:\n\\[\n\\text{span}\\{r_{1},\\cdots,r_{n}\\}\n\\]\nSwapping two rows or scaling a row by a non-zero constant clearly preserves this span. Let us now try to add one row to the other, the third type of elementary operation. Without loss of generality, let us say we add the second row to the first. The span becomes:\n\\[\n\\text{span}\\{r_{1}+r_{2},r_{2},\\cdots,r_{n}\\}\n\\]\nWe need to show the following:\n\\[\n\\text{span}\\{r_{1}+r_{2},r_{2},\\cdots,r_{n}\\}=\\text{span}\\{r_{1},\\cdots,r_{n}\\}\n\\]\nWe will denote these two sets \\(R_{1}\\) and \\(R_{2}\\). Let us take any element \\(R_{1}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{1}(r_{1}+r_{2})+a_{2}r_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}r_{n} & =a_{1}r_{1}+(a_{1}+a_{2})r_{2}+a_{3}r_{3}+\\cdots+a_{n}r_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe see that this element is present in \\(R_{2}\\) as well. Therefore:\n\\[\n\\text{span}\\{r_{1}+r_{2},r_{2},\\cdots,r_{n}\\}\\subset\\text{span}\\{r_{1},\\cdots,r_{n}\\}\n\\]\nTo go the other way, take any element in \\(R_{2}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{1}r_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n}r_{n} & =a_{1}(r_{1}+r_{2})+(a_{2}-a_{1})r_{2}+a_{3}r_{3}+\\cdots+a_{n}r_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe see that this element is there in \\(R_{1}\\) as well. Therefore:\n\\[\n\\text{span}\\{r_{1},\\cdots,r_{n}\\}\\subset\\text{span}\\{r_{1}+r_{2},r_{2},\\cdots,r_{n}\\}\n\\]\nThus, all elementary operations preserve the span of the rows of the original matrix. An important consequence of this is that the row space of a matrix is equal to that of its RREF.",

    "section": "Proof",
    "text": "Proof\nAssume that \\(R_{1}\\) and \\(R_{2}\\) are two RREFs for the matrix \\(A\\). From the observations made so far, \\(R_{1}\\) and \\(R_{2}\\) have the same number of non-zero rows and the span of the non-zero rows of the two matrices are equal, each being equal to the row space of \\(A\\).\nThe pivot columns in \\(R_{1}\\) and \\(R_{2}\\) have to be identical, both in number and position. The number of pivots is equal to the number of non-zero rows, which is the dimension of the row space. So this can’t be different in the RREFs. This leaves us with the possibility of the position of the pivot columns being different. Let us look at a potential contradiction to this:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\boldsymbol{1} &  & 0 &  & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\boldsymbol{1} &  & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\boldsymbol{1}\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} &  & \\begin{bmatrix}\\boldsymbol{1} & 0 &  &  & 0\\\\\n0 & \\boldsymbol{1} & \\boldsymbol{} &  & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\boldsymbol{1}\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAssume that these two matrices are two distinct RREFs for some matrix \\(A\\) with the same number of pivot columns, but at different locations. We know that the row space has dimension \\(3\\), so any set of four vectors in the row space are dependent. If we take the first three rows from the matrix on the left and the second row from the matrix on the right, these four vectors make a linearly independent subset of the row space, which is a contradiction. So the position of the pivot columns have to be the same.\nWe are now back to two RREFs whose general outline looks like this:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\boldsymbol{1} &  & 0 &  & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\boldsymbol{1} &  & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\boldsymbol{1}\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nOnce the pivot columns are fixed for both the RREFs consider the last non-zero row, \\(r_{3}^{(2)}\\), from the second RREF. This should be expressible as a linear combination of the non-zero rows of the first RREF:\n\\[\nr_{3}^{(2)}=a_{1}r_{1}^{(1)}+a_{2}r_{2}^{(1)}+a_{3}r_{3}^{(1)}\n\\]\nWe immediately see that \\(a_{1}=a_{2}=0\\). \\(a_{3}\\) is forced to be \\(1\\) as the pivots have to agree. Thus the last non-zero row is identical in both RREFs. We can now repeat the process for the second non-zero row:\n\\[\nr_{2}^{(2)}=a_{1}r_{1}^{(1)}+a_{2}r_{2}^{(1)}+a_{3}r_{3}^{(1)}\n\\]\n\\(a_{1}=0\\), \\(a_{2}=1\\) and \\(a_{3}=0\\). So the last two rows of the two RREFs are the same. A similar argument shows that all non-zero rows in the two RREFs are the same, which means that the two RREFs are one and the same.",
