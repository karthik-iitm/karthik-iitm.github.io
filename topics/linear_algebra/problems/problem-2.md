Let $U$ and $V$ be two three dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^{5}.$ Show that there exists a non-zero vector $v\in\mathbb{R}^{5}$ which lies in both $U$ and $V$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have:

$$
\text{dim}(U\cap V)=\text{dim}(U)+\text{dim}(V)-\text{dim}(U+V)
$$


The maximum value of $\text{dim}(U+V)$ is $5$, since $U+V$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{5}.$ Therefore, the minimum value of $\text{dim}(U\cap V)$ is $3+3-5=1$. Therefore, $U\cap V$ is a non-trivial subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{5}$. It follows that there exists some non-zero $v\in\mathbb{R}^{5}$ that is in both $U$ and $V$.
