If all the elements of a $n\times n$ matrix $A$ are the same, find the determinant of $A$ and $A+A^{T}$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can perform the row operation $R_{1}\rightarrow R_{1}-R_{2}$. This would leave the determinant unchanged and will result in a zero row. Thus $|A|=0$. Since $A+A^{T}=2A$ for this matrix, $|A+A^{T}|=0$.
