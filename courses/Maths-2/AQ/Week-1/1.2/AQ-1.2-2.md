What is the relationship between the following matrices?

-   diagonal matrix

-   scalar matrix

-   identity matrix

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Diagonal, scalar and identity matrices are all square matrices.

-   An identity matrix is also a scalar matrix.

-   A scalar matrix is also a diagonal matrix.

If $S$ is a scalar matrix, then it can be expressed as $S=cI$ for some scalar $c$, where $I$ is the identity matrix of the same order as the scalar matrix.
