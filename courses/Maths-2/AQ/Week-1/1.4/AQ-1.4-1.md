Let $A$ be a $3\times3$ matrix with non-zero determinant. If $\text{det}(2A)=k\text{det}(A)$, find the value of $k$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a row is scaled by a constant, the determinant is scaled by the same constant. When a matrix is scaled by a constant, each row of the determinant is scaled by the same constant. With this, for a $n\times n$ matrix $A$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{det}(cA) & =c^{n}\text{det}(A)
\end{aligned}
$$


In this question $n=3$ and $c=2$:

$$
\text{det}(2A)=8\text{\ensuremath{\cdot}det}(A)
$$


Therefore, $k=8$.
