Let $A$ be a $2\times2$ matrix, which is given as $\begin{bmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12}\\
a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{bmatrix}$. Consider the following matrices:

$$
\begin{aligned}
B & =\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}-a_{21} & a_{12}-a_{22}\\
a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{bmatrix},C=\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}-a_{12} & a_{12}\\
a_{21}-a_{22} & a_{22}
\end{bmatrix}\\
\\D & =\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}+a_{21} & a_{12}-a_{22}\\
a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{bmatrix},E=\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}-a_{21} & a_{12}+a_{22}\\
a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$


Select all matrices that have the same determinant as that of matrix $A$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   $B$ is obtained by performing the operation $R_{1}\rightarrow R_{1}-R_{2}$ on $A$.

-   $C$ is obtained by performing the operation $C_{1}\rightarrow C_{1}-C_{2}$ on $A$.

We therefore have $|B|=|C|=|A|$. There is no relationship between $|D|$, $|E|$ and $|A|$.
