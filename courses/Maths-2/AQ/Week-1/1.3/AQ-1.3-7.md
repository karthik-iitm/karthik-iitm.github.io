Let $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ be solutions of the system $Ax=b$. Consider the vectors $x_{1}+x_{2}$ and $x_{1}-x_{2}$. These two vectors are the solutions to which system?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are solutions to $Ax=b$, $Ax_{1}=Ax_{2}=b$. We can now perform two operations. The first is adding:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Ax_{1}+Ax_{2} & =2b\\
A(x_{1}+x_{2}) & =2b
\end{aligned}
$$


Thus, $x_{1}+x_{2}$ is a solution to the system $Ax=2b$. Next, subtracting:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Ax_{1}-Ax_{2} & =0\\
A(x_{1}-x_{2}) & =0
\end{aligned}
$$


Thus, $x_{1}-x_{2}$ is a solution to the system $Ax=0$.
