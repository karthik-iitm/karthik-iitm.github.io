Consider a system of equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_{1}-3x_{2} & =4\\
3x_{1}+kx_{2} & =-12
\end{aligned}
$$


where $k\in\mathbb{R}$. For what value of $k$ does this system have:

-   a unique solution

-   infinitely many solutions

-   no solution

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this system to have a unique solution, the slopes of the two equations should be different:

$$
\cfrac{1}{3}\neq\cfrac{-3}{k}\implies k\neq-9
$$


For the system to have infinitely many solutions, the two lines should be identical:

$$
\cfrac{1}{3}=\cfrac{-3}{k}=\cfrac{-1}{3}
$$


This is not possible, so the system will never have infinitely solutions. For no solution, we need the slopes to be identical and the intercepts to be different:

$$
\cfrac{1}{3}=\cfrac{-3}{k}\neq\cfrac{-1}{3}
$$


We have $k=-9$.
