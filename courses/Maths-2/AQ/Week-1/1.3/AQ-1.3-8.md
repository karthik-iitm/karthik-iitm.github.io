Let $v$ be a solution of the systems $A_{1}x=b$ and $A_{2}x=b$. Construct two systems that have $v$ as a solution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As before, we can add these two systems to begin with. Since $v$ is a solution to both systems:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A_{1}v & =b\\
A_{2}v & =b\\
\implies A_{1}v+A_{2}v & =2b\\
\implies(A_{1}+A_{2})v & =2b
\end{aligned}
$$


Thus, $v$ is a solution to the system $(A_{1}+A_{2})x=2b$. Next, subtracting the two systems:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A_{1}v & =b\\
A_{2}v & =b\\
\implies A_{1}v-A_{2}v & =0\\
\implies(A_{1}-A_{2})v & =0
\end{aligned}
$$


Thus, $v$ is a solution to the system $(A_{1}-A_{2})x=0$.
