If $x=(1,2)$ and $y=(2,3)$ are two vectors, compute the following vectors

-   $x+y$

-   $x-y$

-   $2x$

-   $3y$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Addition of vectors happens component wise. We have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x+y & =(1,2)+(2,3)=(3,5)\\
x-y & =(1,2)-(2,3)=(-1,-1)
\end{aligned}
$$


Multiplying a vector by a scalar is done by multiplying each component of the vector by the scalar.

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x & =2(1,2)=(2,4)\\
3y & =3(2,3)=(6,9)
\end{aligned}
$$
