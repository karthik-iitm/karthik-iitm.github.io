Let $v_{1}=(1,0,0),v_{2}=(0,1,0)$ and $v_{3}=(0,0,1)$ be three vectors and let $a,b,c$ be three real numbers. Express the following vectors in terms of $v_{1},v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$.

-   $(a,b,c)$

-   $(a,0,c)$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a\cdot v_{1} & =a\cdot(1,0,0)=(a,0,0)\\
b\cdot v_{2} & =b\cdot(0,1,0)=(0,b,0)\\
c\cdot v_{3} & =c\cdot(0,0,1)=(0,0,c)
\end{aligned}
$$


Therefore, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(a,b,c) & =av_{1}+bv_{2}+cv_{3}\\
(a,0,c) & =av_{1}+cv_{3}
\end{aligned}
$$


We have expressed the vectors $(a,b,c)$ and $(a,0,c)$ as a *linear combination* of the vectors $v_{1},v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$. This is a term that you will see throughout the course.
