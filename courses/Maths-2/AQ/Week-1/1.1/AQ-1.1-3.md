The marks obtained by four students in quiz-1, quiz-2 and the end-term exam are given below:

   Names   Quiz-1   Quiz-2   End-term
  ------- -------- -------- ----------
     A       50       60        60
     B       70       80        90
     C       80       90       100
     D       75       80        85

What is the mathematical quantity associated with each of the following practical quantities:

-   The quiz-1 marks of all students

-   All the marks associated with student B.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The quiz-1 marks of all students represents a column vector. This is usually denoted as:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}50\\
70\\
80\\
75
\end{bmatrix}
$$


This is the second column in the table. Visually, a column vector is represented vertically. This column vector has $4$ components. Each component corresponds to the quiz-1 marks of one of the students.

The marks associated with student B represents a row vector. This is usually denoted as:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}70 & 80 & 90\end{bmatrix}
$$


This is the third column in the table. Visually, a row vector is represented horizontally. This row vector has $3$ components. Each component corresponds to the marks scored by B in an exam.
