The marks obtained by four students in quiz-1, quiz-2 and the end-term exam are given below:

   Names   Quiz-1   Quiz-2   End-term
  ------- -------- -------- ----------
     A       50       60        60
     B       70       80        90
     C       80       90       100
     D       75       80        85

After quiz-2, the students are given bonus marks. A, B, C and D are given the bonus marks $5,6,1$ and $4$ respectively.

-   Represent the bonus marks as a vector. What kind of a vector would this be?

-   Compute the final marks of the students after adding the bonus marks. What is the mathematical operation being performed here?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The current marks of students in quiz-2 is represented by the column vector $\begin{bmatrix}60\\
80\\
90\\
80
\end{bmatrix}$. The bonus marks can also be represented as this column vector: $\begin{bmatrix}5\\
6\\
1\\
4
\end{bmatrix}$. Adding these two vectors will give us the final quiz-2 marks:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}60\\
80\\
90\\
80
\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}5\\
6\\
1\\
4
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}65\\
86\\
91\\
84
\end{bmatrix}
$$
