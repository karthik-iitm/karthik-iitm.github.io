If the diagonal entries of a $3\times3$ lower triangular matrix $A$ are $1,2,3$, find the sum of the roots of the equation $\text{det}(A-xI)=0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

$A-xI$ is also lower triangular. Since the determinant of a lower triangular matrix is the product of the diagonal entries, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{det}(A-xI) & =(1-x)(2-x)(3-x)
\end{aligned}
$$


The roots of $\text{det}(A-xI)=0$ are $1,2,3$. So the sum of the roots is equal to $6$.
